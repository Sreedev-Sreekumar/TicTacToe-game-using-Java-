# Tic Tac Toe with AI (Java Console Game)
A console-based Tic Tac Toe game in Java where a human player competes against a computer AI.

# Project Description

This project implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Java. The player (X) competes against the computer (O) in a 3x3 grid. The computer makes automatic moves using simple AI logic (random move generation). The game continues until a player wins or the match ends in a draw.

This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and basic game logic implementation.

# Game Rules

- Player uses X  
- Computer uses O  
- Enter row and column numbers between 1 and 3  
- First player to complete a row, column, or diagonal wins  
- If all spaces are filled and no winner → Draw
